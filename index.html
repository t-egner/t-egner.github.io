<p3> TRAD ELGSON â€” Classically trained in hipster economics by the guy on the
train that opens his RobinHood account just so that everyone can see it, Trad
decided that the world of economics wasn't for her. Now, she plays the
hurdy-gurdy for Pinkin Lark, which she co-founded with the other members listed
above and below. Her favorite food is hot dogs and she always has at least 20
extra in her freezer, in case of emergency. Her playing style is inspired by
hardcore punk style of Leftover Crack. Her hurdy-gurdy drones are so dark and
haunting, it would make Josquin de Prez cry. </p3>
